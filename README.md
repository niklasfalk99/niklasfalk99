# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Niklas

**MSc Student in Machine Learning at UCL**  

Previously Product Manager & Founder's Associate at Atomico-backed AI Security Start-Up [Lakera](https://lakera.ai).  
Currently researching on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Prof. Emine Yilmaz from the Web Intelligence Group.

## ðŸš€ Featured Projects

- **Semantic Context Tokens: A Coarse-to-Fine Approach to Autoregressive Text Generation:**  
  Developed a novel coarse-to-fine semantic tokenization approach integrating global and local context (inspired by Metaâ€™s Large Concept Model) to enhance autoregressive LLM story generation, boosting narrative cohesion and creativity on the TinyStories benchmark.

- **Domain-Agnostic Novel Agent Design through Autonomous, Open-Ended Evolutionary Search:**  
  Applied evolutionary search to automatically develop intelligent LLM agents that outperform hand-crafted state-of-the-art solutions and benchmarks (inspired by NeurIPS 2024 outstanding paper "Autonomous Design of Agentic Systems"). Find [repository](https://github.com/SebastianSigur/ES-ADAS) and [paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IZnOFobB7bn0eUrppfxdF7BXgG3QuGCL/view?usp=sharing) here.

- **IIElevenLabs x a16z AI Agent Hackathon:**  
  Prototyped Steven, a medical voice co-pilot that listens to the doctor-patient conversation, and then, post-consultation, automates the administrative process and acts as a second brain for medical decision-making. The [demo](https://youtu.be/qXnhOg9lG5M) from the hackathon can be found here.
